Portage-Owncloud-Client
=======================

This is an Overlay to provide the OwnCloud Sync Client for Gentoo.


Example usage:

 cd /usr/local/
 mkdir portage
 cd portage
 git clone git://github.com/Weuxel/portage-owncloud-client.git

Now add the following line to /etc/make.conf
 PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/usr/local/portage/portage-owncloud-client"


Installation:

Unmask the packages
 net-misc/csync
 net-misc/mirall

and install net-misc/mirall
 emerge mirall

net-misc/csync should be pulled in amongst some other dependencies.

Start the client by executing the command "owncloud".

These ebuilds are freshly created and presumably not very mature yet.
Please report problems to devel at smash-net.org
